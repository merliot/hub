<h2>LINES OF CODE</h2>

<p>I'm taking a snapshot of the code base to count the number of lines of code
in the project so far.  The bulk of the hub code is written in Go and Go
templates.  There is a tiny bit of javascript (not counting htmx).  The css
file needs to be clean up and can probably be half its size.  But overall,
adding everything up, the project is at 10122 lines of code.  That includes the
code for the hub, all of the devices, the demo, and this site.</p>

<p>Here's how the 6565 lines of Go code break down per module.  The devices are
about 25% of the total Go code.</p>

<p>This is my first time writing a web site, so I'm not sure how many lines of
code to expect for a project such as this.  10K lines of code seems small.
I've worked on Linux network kernel drivers that were larger.  Maybe this
project could be written in less lines of code?</p>
