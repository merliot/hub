<p>Note: I've had much better luck with the BME280 than the DHT11/DHT22s.</p>

<h5>BME280</h5>

<p>Connect the BME280 sensor as follows:</p>

<pre>
BME280	Arduino Nano Connect
------  --------------------
Vcc	+3.3v
Gnd	Gnd
SCL	D19 (GPIO13, I2C0_SCL_PIN)
SDA	D18 (GPIO12, I2C0_SDA_PIN)
</pre>

<h5>DHT11/DHT22</h5>

<p>Assemble the temp device using the circuit diagram above.</p>

<p>Select the sensor type (DHT11 or DHT22) and select the GPIO for the sensor.
GPIO pin <span class="gpio">D2</span> is used in the diagram, as an example,
and is wired to the DHT11/DHT22 output.</p>
