<h2>UI TO DEVICE</h2>

<p>Sending a message from the UI to the device is a two-step process.  Step 1
is a UI element sends an htmx hx-post request.  Step 2 is translating the
request into a message and delivering the message to the device.</p>

<h3>STEP 1: Issue Request from UI</h3>

<p>Create an HTML element to issue an hx-post request.  The hx-post URL encodes
the request path and parameters.  The path is the action.  The hx-post request
URL format is:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
hx-post="/device/{{id}}/[path]?[params]"
</pre>

<p>In this example, a button will send the http POST request to the device
identified by {{id}} the path /click with the parameters Relay=2.  This tells
the device to "click" relay #2 when the user clicks the button.  (The
hx-swap="none" is used to throw away any http response).</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
&lt;button hx-post="/device/{{id}}/click?Relay=2"
        hx-swap="none"&gt;
        Click Me!
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

<h3>STEP 2: Handle Request in Device</h3>

<p>The device registers a handler for the request path using the GetHandlers()
interface.  The handler specifies a callback function and a type.  The callback
function is called on receipt of an hx-post request matching /path.  Continuing
the example, /click will be handled by the r.click() callback function.</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
func (r *Relays) GetHandlers() hub.Handlers {
	return hub.Handlers{
		"/click":   &amp;hub.Handler[MsgClick]{r.click},
		// ... other handlers
	}
}
</pre>

<p>The handler is typed.  In the example, the handler type for /click is
MsgClick.  MsgClick is a message structure which will recieve the [params] from
the hx-post request.  The type members are Go exported (first letter capital)
and match the [params] names exactly.</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
type MsgClick struct {
	Relay int
}
</pre>

<p>The handler callback receives a packet containing the JSON-encoded typed
message.  Call pkt.Unmarshal() to get the message from the packet.  In our
example, the /click?Relay=2 request is received in the callback with
click.Relay=2.</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
func (r *Relays) click(pkt *hub.Packet) {
	var click MsgClick
	pkt.Unmarshal(&amp;click)
	// ... click.Relay == 2
}
</pre>
