<h4>DEVICE TO UI</h4>

<p>The device can route packets up the network tree using Packet.RouteUp().
Packets are routed to uplinks and sessions.</p>

<img src="/docs/images/route-up.png">

<p>An uplink is a dialed connection from the device to another device,
typically a hub.  A device may be dialed into multiple uplinks.  The uplink
device will process the incoming packets using the device packet handlers.</p> 

<p>A session is an active http session.  Active because each session opens a
websocket which persists the lifetime of the session.  Packets are transformed
into html snippets and sent to the http client over the websocket, per <a
target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/extensions/ws/">htmx</a>.</p>

<h3>UPLINKS</h3>

<p>Each uplink is a websocket connected on /ws.  The packet is JSON-encoded
before sending on the websocket, and JSON-decoded by the receiving device.
Let's send up a /clicked message for a relay state change:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
var msg = MsgClicked{Relay: 2, State: true}
pkt.SetPath("/clicked").Marshal(&amp;msg).RouteUp()
</pre>

<p>The receiving device will catch the /clicked message using a packet handler:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
func (r *Relays) GetHandlers() hub.Handlers {
	return hub.Handlers{
		"/clicked":   &amp;hub.Handler[MsgClick]{r.clicked},
		// ... other handlers
	}
}

func (r *relays) clicked(pkt *hub.Packet) {
	var clicked msgClicked
	pkt.Unmarshal(&amp;clicked)
	// update state
	relay := &amp;r.Relays[clicked.Relay]
	relay.Set(clicked.State)
	// forward /clicked packet up
	pkt.RouteUp()
}
</pre>

<p>The handler will decode the packet and typically update the device state and
forward the packet up</p>

<h3>SESSIONS</h3>

<p>A session is an http(s) client (browser, etc) that has also opened, and is
listening on, a websocket at /wsx.  The browser opens the websocket using htmx.</p>

<p>There may be multiple sessions open on a device.  The device will forward
the packet up to each active session.</p>

<p>A packet is transformed into an html snippet before being forwarded on the
websocket to the client (see htmx, websockets).  The packet path and the
current session's view name the html template used for the transformation.  The
template name is in the format:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">
{path}-{view}.tmpl
</pre>

For example, consider routing the packet from earlier:

<pre class="code-snippet">
var msg = MsgClicked{Relay: 2, State: true}
pkt.SetPath("/clicked").Marshal(&amp;msg).RouteUp()
</pre>

And say the current <a href="/doc/device-views">view</a> is "overview".
The template name would be:

<pre class="cmd-line">
clicked-overview.tmpl
</pre>

The template is executed and the resulting html snippet is sent on the
websocket.  Per htmx, the html snippet is swap by DOM id, so use a
unique id in the template like:

&lt;pre class="code-snippet"&gt;
&lt;div id="{{uniq `relay`}}"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
