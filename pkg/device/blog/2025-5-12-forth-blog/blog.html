<h2>PIVOT TO AI</h2>

<p>I'm pivoting the project to AI.  I kindof feel like a sell-out.  The
previous (unreleased) version of the project focused on privacy.  The tag line
was "Merliot, Private Device Hub".  I've demoted privacy to be just a feature
now and pivoting the project to AI.  The pivot is for two reasons:</p>

<p>First, AI is hot right now and Privacy is not.  I wish the reverse was true.
I'm close to releasing this project so why not announce for most clicks?  I'm
kind of glad I've procrastinated in releasing.  Now it looks like it was
AI-enabled from the start.  It wasn't, but...</p>

<p>Second, what's really weird is the LLM plug-in model (MCP) really suits
Merliot Hub.  Writing the MCP Server code for Merliot Hub just kind of fell
out.  The hub already has an API, so mapping the API over to MCP tools was
straight forward.  The devices also have some APIs and hooks to generate
device-specific MCP tools, which is pretty cool, and it's generated from
meta-data of the device so there wasn't much work to code that up.  Any
finally, async events from the device are translated into MCP notifications
sent back to the MCP client.  These means the LLM host (Cursor, Claude) will
see those device notifications.  So that means the LLM can listen for device
events to update context.</p>

<p>I think this project is supposed to be this way.  I think the LLMs want to
be plugged into the physical world.  They've tricked me into enabling my
project to that end.  I'm sure others have been tricked as well and have
already plugged LLMs in.  Well played LLMs, you win.</p>
