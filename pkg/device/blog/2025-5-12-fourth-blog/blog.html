<h2>PIVOT TO AI</h2>

<p>I'm pivoting the project to AI.  I kind of feel like a sell-out.  The
previous (unreleased) version of the project focused on privacy.  The tag line
was "Merliot, Private Device Hub".  I've now demoted privacy to be just a
project feature and pivoting the project focus to AI.  The pivot is for two
reasons:</p>

<p>First, AI is hot right now and Privacy is not.  I wish the reverse was true.
I'm close to releasing this project so why not announce for most clicks?  I'm
kind of glad I've procrastinated in releasing.  Now it looks like it was
AI-enabled from the start.  It wasn't, but...</p>

<p>Second, what's really weird is the LLM plug-in model (MCP) really suits
Merliot Hub.  Writing the MCP Server code for Merliot Hub just kind of fell
out.  The hub already has an API, so mapping the API over to MCP tools was
straightforward.  The devices also have some APIs and hooks to generate
device-specific MCP tools, which is pretty cool, and it's generated from
metadata of the device so there wasn't much work to code that up.  And
finally, async events from the device are translated into MCP notifications
sent back to the MCP client.  This means the LLM host (Cursor, Claude) will
see those device notifications.  So that means the LLM can listen for device
events to update context.</p>

<p>I think this project is supposed to be this way.  I think the LLMs want to
be plugged into the physical world.  They've tricked me into enabling my
project to that end.  I'm sure others have been tricked as well and have
already plugged in LLMs.  Well played LLMs, you win.</p>
