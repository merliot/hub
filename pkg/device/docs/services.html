<h2>SERVICES</h2>

<p>Devices installed on Linux targets (x86-64, rpi) are installed as a systemd
service, which will automatically restart on system reboot (and in the event of
a service crash, hopefully unlikely).  Systemd services are managed with
<code>systemctl</code>.  The Merliot Hub devices are installed under the
merliot.target systemd unit.</p>

<p>To see currently installed device services:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">
$ systemctl list-dependencies merliot.target
merliot.target
● ├─gadget-bb06fac6.service
● └─gadget-g1.service
</pre>

<p>To stop/start/restart a device service:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">
$ sudo systemctl stop &lt;service&gt;
$ sudo systemctl start &lt;service&gt;
$ sudo systemctl restart &lt;service&gt;
</pre>

<p>Where &lt;service&gt; is device service name.  For example, to stop gadget-g1 device:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">
$ sudo systemctl stop gadget-g1
</pre>

<p>To pass in environment variables to device (useful for debugging), stop the
service, set the variables, and start the service:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">
$ sudo systemctl stop gadget-g1
$ sudo systemctl set-environment DEBUG_KEEP_BUILDS=true LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
$ sudo systemctl start gadget-g1
</pre>
