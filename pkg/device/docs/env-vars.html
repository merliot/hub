<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>

<p>When the hub starts, it will read run-time settings from the environment
variables listed below.</p>

<p>If running from Docker, use --env or -e:

<pre class="cmd-line">$ docker run -e DEMO=true -p 8000:8000 merliot/hub</pre>

<p>If running from source, just prefix the command with the environment variables:</p>

<pre class="cmd-line">$ DEMO=true go run ./cmd/</pre>

<div>
	<h3 id="PORT">PORT</h3>
	<p>Port on which the hub web server runs. Defaults to 8000.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="DEVICES">DEVICES</h3>

	<p>DEVICES can be set to a JSON-encoded map of
	<a href="/doc/devices">devices</a> in the device tree.  Here's an
	example of a hub with two devices:</p>

	<pre class="code-snippet">
{
	"qrcode1": {
		"Id": "qrcode1",
		"Model": "qrcode",
		"Name": "QR Code",
		"Children": null,
		"DeployParams": "target=wioterminal"
	},
	"gps1": {
		"Id": "gps1",
		"Model": "gps",
		"Name": "GPS",
		"Children": null,
		"DeployParams": "target=nano-rp2040"
	},
	"hub": {
		"Id": "hub",
		"Model": "hub",
		"Name": "Hub",
		"Children": [
			"gps1",
			"qrcode1",
		],
		"DeployParams": "target=x86-64\u0026port=8000"
	}
}
	</pre>

</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="DEVICES_FILE">DEVICES_FILE</h3>
	<p>DEVICES_FILE is set to a file path for JSON-encoded <a href="/doc/devices">devices</a> file.
	If DEVICES is also given, then DEVICES takes presedence over
	DEVICES_FILE.  If neither DEVICES nor DEVICES_FILE are given, the
	hub defaults to reading 'devices.json'.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="AUTO_SAVE">AUTO_SAVE</h3>
	<p>AUTO_SAVE set to "true" will automatically save device changes to
	the devices.json file.  Only applicable if DEVICES environment variable
	is not defined.  If AUTO_SAVE is set to "false", user must manually
	save device changes.<p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="USER">USER</h3>
	<p>Username for authentication.  If non-blank, a new client session
	will prompt for the user/passwd.  In addition, devices created from the
	hub will also use same user/passwd to authenticate when they dial back
	to the hub.  The authentication is done using
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication.</a></p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="PASSWD">PASSWD</h3>
	<p>Password for authentication.  Only valid if USER is non-blank</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="WIFI_SSIDS">WIFI_SSIDS</h3>

	<p>Comma-separated list of WiFi SSIDs.  Each SSID in the list has a
	matching passphrase in WIFI_PASSPHRASES.  The SSID and passphrase pair
	is used by embedded devices (targets: nano-rp2040, wioterminal, etc) to
	connect to the hub via a WiFi router.  E.g.:</p>

	<pre class="cmd-line">
WIFI_SSIDS="Home WiFi,Phone Hot Spot"
WIFI_PASSPHRASES="xxx,yyy"
	</pre>

	<p>Where xxx is passphrase to "Home Wifi" router and "yyy" is
	passphrase for "Phone Hot Spot".</p>

	<p>The WIFI_SSIDS populate the Wifi selector in device settings.  (The
	passphrases are not visible).</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="WIFI_PASSPHRASES">WIFI_PASSPHRASES</h3>
	<p>Comma-separated list of WiFi passphrases.  This list pairs
	the passphrases with the SSIDs set in WIFI_SSIDS.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="DIAL_URLS">DIAL_URLS</h3>
	<p>Comma-separated URLs for dialing parent hub(s).  These URLs will be
	websocket connections in the format:</p>

	<pre class="cmd-line text-wrap">
ws://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/ws
	</pre>

	<p>or if using https:</p>

	<pre class="cmd-line text-wrap">
wss://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/ws
	</pre>

	<p>where host:port is the address of the parent hub.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="PING_PERIOD">PING_PERIOD</h3>
	<p>Client ping period, in seconds.  To keep the websocket connection
	alive, the client (browser) uses htmx's ws-send to send a ping packet
	back to the server (hub).  The default is 2.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</h3>
	<p>Background color: LIGHT or DARK.  Default is DARK.</p>
</div>

<h2>DEBUG ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>

<div>
	<h3 id="LOG_LEVEL">LOG_LEVEL</h3>
	<p>Set the hub logging level.  The options are "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN",
	and "ERROR", in that order.  The default is "INFO", meaning only
	"INFO", "WARN", and "ERROR" would be logged.  Set to "DEBUG" to catch
	additional debug info.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="DEMO">DEMO</h3>
	<p>Runs the hub in demo mode if set to "true".  In demo mode, all the
	devices on the hub will run locally on the hub, simulating the devices.
	Demo mode is handy for demos, but also for device developement and
	testing.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="SITE">SITE</h3>
	<p>Runs the hub in site mode if set to "true".  Implies demo mode.
	The hub and devices are locked (read-only) in site mode.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="DEBUG_KEEP_BUILDS">DEBUG_KEEP_BUILDS</h3>
	<p>If set to "true", keeps build artifacts for debugging.</p>
</div>
