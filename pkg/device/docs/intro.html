<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Merliot Hub is an AI-integrated device hub.</p>

<p>What does that mean?  It means you can control and interact with your physical
devices, your security cameras, your thermometer, seamlessly using natural
language from an LLM host such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
or [Cursor](https://cursor.com).  The hub is a gateway between AI and the
physical world.</p>

<h4>Devices</h4>

<p>Which devices?  Sorry, not any of the consumer-grade Smart devices such as
Smart security cameras, Smart lights, and Smart thermostats.  Merliot Hub only
supports devices you build.  You build devices from hobby-grade components
which are readily available, like Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, buttons, relays, and
sensors.  You need maker-level skills to build the devices.  The hub includes a
parts list and instructions for building each device.  There is no software to
write; the hub includes the downloadable device firmware.</p>

<h3>FEATURES</h3>

<h4>Privacy</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
	    Merliot Hub uses a distributed architecture rather than a
	    centralized architecture, eliminating third-party access to your
	    devices' data. You install and maintain your own hub and devices.
	    No one else has access. Your data is private. Your data can't be
	    sold, shared, stored, analyzed, or surveilled by third parties.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Web App</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
	    Merliot hub is a web app. There is no phone app. You can use any
	    web browser on any device, including your phone, to access your
	    hub, locally or over the internet. Try the <a href="/demo">demo</a>

    <h4>AI-Integration</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>

	    Merliot Hub is a Model Context Protocol
	    (<a href="/doc/mcp-server">MCP</a>)
	    server. The MCP server lets you plug your Merliot Hub into LLM
	    hosts such as Claude or Cursor. From there, you can chat with the
	    hub using natural language:

            <pre class="code-snippet">
"List all of the devices in a tree view"
"Add a new gps device"
"Turn on all the relays"
"Show the instructions on how to deploy a qrcode device"
            </pre>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cloud-Ready</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
	    Merliot Hub is packaged as a Docker image so you can run your hub
	    anywhere you can run a Docker image, locally on your own laptop or
	    server using Docker Desktop, or on the cloud. See 
	    <a href="/doc/install">install</a> guide for more
	    info. The docker image requires a minimal VM: 0.1vCPU, 256MB RAM, 256MB
	    disk. Koyeb offers a FREE VM suitable for running a hub in the cloud.
