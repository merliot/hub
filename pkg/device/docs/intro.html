<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Merliot Hub is a private device hub, a web app, and an MCP server.</p>

<p>That is a lot to unpack.  Let’s start with the private device hub part.</p>

<h3>Private Hub</h3>

<p>Consider consumer-grade Smart devices such as Smart security cameras, Smart
lights, and Smart thermostats.  These are not private.  They have one thing in
common: they dial home to the device manufacturer's central hub.  For each
manufacture, you'll install a phone app which connects to the same central hub.
Your data is unencrypted on the manufacture's side of the hub.  Your data is
not private.  The device manufacturer can analyze, track, store, share, and
sell your data.  Your data plus your profile associated with the device
purchase and app signup make <i>you</i> the product.</p>

<p>Merliot Hub is private alternative.  It’s private by switching from a
central-hub architecture to a distributed-hub architecture.  There is no
central Merliot Hub.  Each user of Merliot Hub installs their own hub.  A hub
can be installed on a local resource such as a laptop or Raspberry Pi.
Alternatively, it can be installed on the cloud (for free in some cases).  Each
user’s hub is independent from others’.  There is no central hub.  No central
point to compromise, tap, exploit, or profit from.</p>

<p>The trade off for privacy is convenience.  You must <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.merliot.io/doc/quick-start">install</a> and maintain your own
Merliot Hub and you must to build your own devices.  Merliot Hub devices are
built from hobbyist-level components that are readily available.  There are
camera, gps, relay, timer and other devices you can build for the hub.
Assembling the devices requires maker-level skills.  There is no software to
write, unless you want to create a new device model.  (Fun fact: <a

can write device models).</p>

<h3>Web App</h3>

<p>Merliot Hub is a web app.  There is no phone app.  But, you can use any
browser on any device, including your phone, to access your hub, locally or
over the internet.  Just point the browser to the hub address.</p>

<p>Try the demo to get a feel for the UI.</p>

<h3>MCP Server</h3>

<p>Merliot Hub is a Model Context Protocol (<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.merliot.io/doc/mcp-server">MCP</a>) server.
The MCP server lets you plug your Merliot Hub into LLM hosts such as <a
target="_blank" href="https://claude.ai/download">Claude Desktop</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>.  From there,
you can chat with the hub using natural language:</p>

"List all of the devices in a tree view"
"Add a new gps device"
"Turn on all the relays"
"Show the instructions on how to deploy a qrcode device"
</pre>
