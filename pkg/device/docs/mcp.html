<h2>MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL</h2>

<p>Merliot Hub devices supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in two ways:</p>
 
<p>Any PacketHandler with a path with a leading "/" will create a MCP tool
that's custom for that device.  For example, consider the PacketHandlers:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
PacketHandlers: device.PacketHandlers{
	"/click":  &amp;device.PacketHandler[msgClick]{r.click},
	"clicked": &amp;device.PacketHandler[msgClicked]{r.clicked},
}
</pre>

<p>A MCP tool called "relays_click" is created for the "/click" handler.  In
general, the tool name will be {model}_{path}, with the leading "/" removed
from the path.  No tool is created for "clicked" handler since it does not have
a leading "/".</p>

<p>The tool parameters are derived from the handler type.  In our example, the
"/click" handler's type is msgClick.</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
type msgClick struct {
	Relay int `mcp:"required,desc=Relay index"`
}

func (m msgClick) Desc() string {
	return "Click (toggle) the relay"
}
</pre>

<p>Field in the type struct must be tagged with `mcp` to be included in the
tools input parameters.  In our example, Relay field is tagged with `mcp` to it
will be included in the tool input parameters.  The device id is also an input
parameter for each custom device tool.</p>

<p>The type struct itself should include a Desc() function to return a
description of the tool.</p>
