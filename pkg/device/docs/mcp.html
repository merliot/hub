<h2>MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL</h2>

<p>Merliot Hub devices supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in two ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Custom MCP Tools</p>
		<p>Custom tools for the device are generated from the
		device's PacketHandlers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Unsolicited MCP Notifications.</p>
		<p>Unsolicited MCP notifications are sent for each Packet routed up.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>CUSTOM TOOLS</h3>
 
<p>Any PacketHandler with a path with a leading "/" will create a MCP tool
that's custom for that device.  For example, consider the PacketHandlers:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
PacketHandlers: device.PacketHandlers{
	"/click":  &amp;device.PacketHandler[msgClick]{r.click},
	"clicked": &amp;device.PacketHandler[msgClicked]{r.clicked},
}
</pre>

<p>A MCP tool called "relays_click" is created for the "/click" handler.  In
general, the tool name will be {model}_{path}, with the leading "/" removed
from the path.  No tool is created for "clicked" handler since it does not have
a leading "/".</p>

<p>The tool parameters are derived from the handler type.  In our example, the
"/click" handler's type is msgClick.</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
type msgClick struct {
	Relay int `schema:"required,desc=Relay index"`
}

func (m msgClick) Desc() string {
	return "Click (toggle) the relay"
}
</pre>

<p>Field in the type struct must be tagged with `schema` to be included in the
tools input parameters.  In our example, Relay field is tagged with `schema` to it
will be included in the tool input parameters.  The device id is also an input
parameter for each custom device tool.</p>

<p>The type struct itself should include a Desc() function to return a
description of the tool.</p>

<h3>NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
 
<p>Any Packet that is routed up will be turned into a MCP notification.  The notification method is "notification/update" and the parameters include:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
params := map[string]any{
	"dst_id": pkt.Dst,
	"path":   pkt.Path,
	"msg":    msgContent,
}
</pre>
