<h2>MCP SERVER</h2>

<p>Merliot Hub supports Model Context Protocol (MCP).  MCP allows LLM hosts to
"plug-in" to external context.  Merliot Hub includes a MCP Server which lets
LLM hosts "plug-in" to the hub.  Now, using the LLM, we can "chat" with the hub
using natural language:</p>

			<pre class="cmd-line">
"List all of the devices in a tree view"
"Add a new gps device"
"Turn on all the relays"
"Show the instructions on how to deploy a qrcode device"
			</pre>

<h3>INSTALL</h3>

<p>Click on the tool icon on the root-level hub</p>

<p>Follow the instructions to download and install the MCP server for your
local platform.  The MCP server only supports stdio transport.  The MCP server
will automatically connect to the hub once plugged into an LLM host.  More than
one LLM host may be using a MCP Server to connect to the hub.</p>
