<h4 class="w-80">ABOUT DEMO</h4>

<p>The devices aren't real, they're simulated, running in demo mode.</p>

<p>But, you can <a href="/doc/install">install</a> your own hub and it'll work
and look just like the demo, except you'll have real devices.</p>

<p>Try opening the demo in multiple windows or from multiple devices and see
how state is maintained across all views of the device.  In fact, someone else
may be viewing the demo and poking buttons causing your view to update.</p>
