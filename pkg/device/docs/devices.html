<h2>DEVICES</h2>

<p>When a hub starts, it reads a definition of the hub's devices from a
'devices.json' file.  The file is a JSON-encoded map of devices in the device
tree.  An example devices.json file for a hub with two devices is:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
{
	"qrcode1": {
		"Id": "qrcode1",
		"Model": "qrcode",
		"Name": "QR Code",
		"Children": null,
		"DeployParams": "target=wioterminal"
	},
	"gps1": {
		"Id": "gps1",
		"Model": "gps",
		"Name": "GPS",
		"Children": null,
		"DeployParams": "target=nano-rp2040"
	},
	"hub": {
		"Id": "hub",
		"Model": "hub",
		"Name": "Hub",
		"Children": [
			"gps1",
			"qrcode1",
		],
		"DeployParams": "target=x86-64\u0026port=8000"
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Note that the hub is included.  The hub is also a device!  The devices are keyed by device ID, and duplicate device IDs are not allowed.</p>

<style>
table {
  width: 100%; /* Makes the table take up full width */
  border-collapse: collapse; /* Prevents double borders */
}

th, td {
  border: 1px solid;
  padding: 8px; /* Adds padding inside cells */
  text-align: left; /* Left-aligns text in cells */
}

th {
    text-align: left; /*left justifies the headings*/
}
</style>

<p>Each device has five fields:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Field</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Example (from JSON)</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Id</code></td>
			<td>A unique identifier for the device.  Non-blank, alpha-numeric, with '-' and '_' chars allowed.</td>
			<td><code>"qrcode1"</code>, <code>"gps1"</code>, <code>"hub"</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Model</code></td>
			<td>The model of the device.  Non-blank, alpha-numeric, with '-' and '_' chars allowed.</td>
			<td><code>"qrcode"</code>, <code>"gps"</code>, <code>"hub"</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Name</code></td>
			<td>A human-readable name for the device.  Non-blank.</td>
			<td><code>"QR Code"</code>, <code>"GPS"</code>, <code>"Hub"</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Children</code></td>
			<td>An array of child device IDs (if the device is a parent/container).</td>
			<td><code>["gps1", "qrcode1"]</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>DeployParams</code></td>
			<td>Parameters used for device deployment, specifying a target and other options.</td>

<h3>DEVICE TREES</h3>

<p>The devices file must contain a single device tree with a single root
device, typically the hub device.  A file with multiple trees will not load.</p>

<p>The device tree may be multiple levels deep, with hubs containing hubs, etc.</p>

<h3>LOADING DEVICES</h3>

<p>By default, the hub will load devices from the 'devices.json' file. If the
environment <a href="/doc/env-vars">variable</a>
DEVICES_FILE is set to a file path, the devices will be loaded from that
file.</p>

<p>If the DEVICES environment variable is set, devices will be loaded directly
from DEVICES, ignoring DEVICES_FILE. Using DEVICES is primarily for cloud
environments where there is no file storage.</p>

<h3>SAVING DEVICES</h3>

<p>If devices were loaded from a file, then any changes are saved back to the
same file. If the environment variable AUTO_SAVE is "true", then changes are
saved automatically. If AUTO_SAVE is not set, then the user must manually save
changes.</p>

<p>If devices were loaded from DEVICES, then changes must be saved manually by
updating the DEVICES environment variable.</p>
