<h2>PRIVACY</h2>

<p>Privacy is a main feature of Merliot Hub.</p>

<p>Consider consumer-grade Smart devices such as Smart security cameras, Smart
lights, and Smart thermostats.  These are not private.  They have one thing in
common: they dial home to the device manufacturer's central hub.  For each
manufacturer, you'll install a phone app which connects to the same central hub.
Your data is unencrypted on the manufacturer's side of the hub.  Your data is
not private.  The device manufacturer can analyze, track, store, share, and
sell your data.  Your data plus your profile associated with the device
purchase and app signup make _you_ the product.</p>

<p>Merliot Hub is a private alternative.  It’s private by switching from a
central-hub architecture to a distributed-hub architecture.  There is no
central Merliot Hub.  Each user of Merliot Hub installs their own hub.  A hub
can be installed on a local resource such as a laptop or Raspberry Pi.
Alternatively, it can be installed on the cloud (for free in some cases).  Each
user’s hub is independent from others’.  There is no central hub.  No central
point to compromise, tap, exploit, or profit from.</p>

<p>The trade off for privacy is convenience.  You must <a target="_blank"

Merliot Hub and you must to build your own devices.</p>
